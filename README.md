# Docker containers for the Sentinel Application Platform

Docker containers including ESA-STEP Sentinel Application Platform ([SNAP]( http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/)) and Sentinel toolboxes jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, Array Systems Computing and C-S.

Some useful utlities containers are also included.

## Details
The SNAP installer, created with [install4j](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html) from [ej-technologies](http://www.ej-technologies.com/index.html), supports graphical, console and unattended installation (see [Install SNAP on the command line](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SNAP/Install+SNAP+on+the+command+line). 

The base container downloads the SNAP Unix installer and prepares the container ready for installation using [Dockerfile `ONBUILD` instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild). For improved maintenance ONBUILD instructions are stored in a seperate Dockerfile; meaning less builds of the base image. Upon initiating a specific build, the `snap2.varfile` which contains the build options is copied to the container and the unattended installation of SNAP within the container is done by passing the option `-q` and the 'instalation file' to the installer via the `-varfile` option (all these commands are found in the `:on_build` Dockerfile, whereas the instalations instructions are in `snap2.varfile`). The Dockerfiles in each build directory mainly add metadata (labels, ect.).

SNAP has 2 headless APIs, `gpt` a mature command line interface and `snappy` a Python API. To facilitate the communication with SNAP via `snappy` a set of containers that include Python 2.7 (from the Debian package distribution system) are also available, note the Python instalation is intentially minimal and 'frozen' to a debian package release. 

Note: An initial (quick) test with [1science/docker-alpine:3.3](https://github.com/1science/docker-alpine) suggested The SNAP installer does not work with the minimilist Docker image from Alpine Linux; Error unpacking jar files. The architecture or bitness (32/64) of the bundled JVM might not match your machine. However, on the Alpine Linux distribution site 64bit version are available. More research to be done! 

## Installation

1.  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

1. Choose your flavour!

+ Use a pre-made container (replace `:tag` with the version you want)
    + Download build from public [Docker Registry](https://index.docker.io/): `docker pull epmorris/debian8-snap2:s1tbx`
    + Alternatively, you can build an image from Dockerfile (replace `:tag` and the repository subdirectory with the version you want): `docker build -t="epmorris/debian8-snap2:s1tbx" github.com/edwardpmorris/docker-snap.git#:debian8-snap2-s1tbx`)
 
+ Build a custom container...

## Usage

### SNAP containers
To run a container (choose the container flavour using the `:tag` option) and view the help for the SNAP command line API, `gpt`, open a terminal and type:

```
docker run --rm epmorris/debian8-snap2:s1tbx gpt -h
```

+ adding vmoptions:
```
docker run -it -v /home/edward/snap/bin/gpt.vmoptions:/usr/local/snap/bin/gpt.vmoptions epmorris/debian8-esa-step-snap2:s1tbx
```

### Sen2Cor

To get help for the Sen2Cor command line interface:
```
docker run --rm epmorris/sen2cor:2.0.6 L2A_Process -h
```
Run atmospheric correction on a image

```
docker run -it -v /home/edward/Desktop/S2:/home/worker/S2 epmorris/sen2cor:2.0.6
```
