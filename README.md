# Docker containers for the Sentinel Application Platform

Docker containers including ESA-STEP Sentinel Application Platform ([SNAP]( http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/)) and Sentinel toolboxes jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, Array Systems Computing and C-S.

Some useful utlities containers for Sentinel data are also included.

## Status
+ pre alpha, in development and may change at anytime without notice
+ headless debian containers available 
+ images not yet on Dockerhub.

## Versions

### Headless SNAP with toolboxes, `gpt` command line API
+ [debian8-snap2:base]() - Base container used to build SNAP and toolboxes (~550 Mb).
+ [debian8-snap2:s1tbx]()  - Base container with SNAP + S1TBX (~ 1Gb).
+ [debian8-snap2:s2tbx]()  - Base container with SNAP + S2TBX (~ 1Gb).
+ [debian8-snap2:s3tbx]()  - Base container with SNAP + S3TBX (~ 1Gb).

### Headless SNAP with toolboxes, `snappy` Python API enabled
RETHINK: Why not just make Python available by default in all? Python is already weel integrated into debian so no real overhead?

+ [debian8-snap2:base]() - Base container with Python used to build snap and toolboxes ( Mb) [TODO]


### Utilities
+ alpine3-pythonX-sentinelsat Python container with sentinelsat 0.6.4 a utility to search and download Sentinel-1 Imagery [TODO]
+ java8-maven-git-snapdev (https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesdbloom/docker-java8-maven/) For compiling developer versions of snap using netbeans.[TODO]

## Dependencies

+ [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)
+ [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)
+ [python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/)
+ [docker-java8-maven](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesdbloom/docker-java8-maven/)

## Details
The SNAP installer, created with [install4j](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html) from [ej-technologies](http://www.ej-technologies.com/index.html), supports graphical, console and unattended installation (see [Install SNAP on the command line](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SNAP/Install+SNAP+on+the+command+line). 

The base container downloads the SNAP Unix installer and prepares the container ready for installation using the Dockerfile `ONBUILD` instruction. Upon initiating a build, the `snap2.varfile` which contains the specific build options is copied to the container and the unattended installation of SNAP within containers is done by passing the option `-q` and the 'instalation file' to the installer via the `-varfile` option (all these commands are found in the `:base` Dockerfile).

This keeps maintenance minimal (i.e., changes to the base container propagate), means the Dockerfiles for each build are more for adding metadata (labels, ect.) and builds can be easily adjusted.

## Installation

1.  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

1. Choose your flavour!

+ Use a pre-made container (replace `:tag` with the version you want)
    + Download build from public [Docker Registry](https://index.docker.io/): `docker pull epmorris/debian8-snap2:s1tbx`
    + Alternatively, you can build an image from Dockerfile (replace `:tag` and the repository subdirectory with the version you want): `docker build -t="epmorris/debian8-snap2:s1tbx" github.com/edwardpmorris/docker-snap.git#:debian8-snap2-s1tbx`)
 
+ Build a custom container...

## Usage

To run a container (choose the container flavour using the `:tag` option) and view the help for the SNAP command line API, `gpt`, open a terminal and type:

```
docker run --rm epmorris/debian8-snap2:s1tbx gpt -h
```

+ adding vmoptions:
```
docker run -it -v /home/edward/snap/bin/gpt.vmoptions:/usr/local/snap/bin/gpt.vmoptions epmorris/debian8-esa-step-snap2:s1tbx
```
+ check why PATH assignment is not permenant in container
